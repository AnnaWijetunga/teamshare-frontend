# TeamShare (front end)

TeamShare is a mobile app built using a Rails API back end, which communicates with the front end, built with React Native.

## Overview

TeamShare is just what you need to work on any project with a partner or a team. Create an account (or log in to an existing account) in order to track projects you're working on in collaboration with your team.

At any moment, you can see any and all users working on your project, as well as the deadline for its completion. You can also track objectives per project, and each objective can belong to one or many users.

Once complete, you can mark a project as completed and move on to the next project.

Happy building!

## Installation

Fork and clone repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/aohibbard/teamshare-api
    $ git clone https://github.com/AnnaWijetunga/teamshare-frontend

Using two terminals, switch to each respective directory

    $ cd evergoal-backend
    $ cd evergoal-frontend

Startup the server (within the back end terminal)

    $ rails s

Enter in browser to launch the rails server

    $ localhost:3000

Startup the server (within the front end terminal)

    $ npm start

You may be prompted to use an alternate port - type Y or YES. Then, a new browser window will open with Evergoal.

## Usage

Welcome! Click My Goals, and there you will see the a form for setting a new goal. You will add the Aim (short title) and your Strategy (a sentence or two encapsulating how you'll accomplish this goal).

Click Add Goal to add the goal!

Once added, it will display above the form - and there you can click on that goal to edit it and add objectives OR you can delete the goal.

If choosing to edit, click on that goal and then you can add objectives to your goal. Make them actionable and bite-sized, usually a sentence or fragment will do. Click submit or hit enter and your objective will be posted. 

From there, you can check the box, to show you've completed an objective, or you can click to X to delete it entirely.

Click Home at any time to go back to your Homepage, and click My Goals to continue working on existing goals or add a new one. Happy goal setting!
