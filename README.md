# Evergoal (front end)

Evergoal was built using a Rails API back end, which communicates with the front end, built with React and Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Overview

Evergoal is perfect for professionals who want to easily organize their personal and professional goals in one tidy place. This goal organizer can help keep you organized while also tracking goal progress over time.

You can add a new goal, and within that goal, add many new objectives to help keep your goal actionable. Once an objective is complete, you can check the box - complete! You can delete the entire goal, or any of the objectives, at any time.

## Installation

Fork and clone repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/AnnaWijetunga/evergoal-backend
    $ git clone https://github.com/AnnaWijetunga/evergoal-frontend

Using two terminals, switch to each respective directory

    $ cd evergoal-backend
    $ cd evergoal-frontend

Startup the server (within the back end terminal)

    $ rails s

Enter in browser to launch the rails server

    $ localhost:3000

Startup the server (within the front end terminal)

    $ npm start

You may be prompted to use an alternate port - type Y or YES. Then, a new browser window will open with Evergoal.

## Usage

Welcome! Click My Goals, and there you will see the a form for setting a new goal. You will add the Aim (short title) and your Strategy (a sentence or two encapsulating how you'll accomplish this goal).

Click Add Goal to add the goal!

Once added, it will display above the form - and there you can click on that goal to edit it and add objectives OR you can delete the goal.

If choosing to edit, click on that goal and then you can add objectives to your goal. Make them actionable and bite-sized, usually a sentence or fragment will do. Click submit or hit enter and your objective will be posted. 

From there, you can check the box, to show you've completed an objective, or you can click to X to delete it entirely.

Click Home at any time to go back to your Homepage, and click My Goals to continue working on existing goals or add a new one. Happy goal setting!
